Please update the Testimonials page as follows:

Remove placeholders

Delete all fake/dummy testimonials currently on the page.

Do not change the page URL, header, or existing styling framework.

Import real testimonials from https://yogabahia.com/reviews/

Copy the student testimonials from that page (verbatim, light fixes for obvious typos only).

Curate 21 testimonials (to fit rows of 3 cleanly). If fewer than 21 are suitable, use 18; if more are strong, cap at 21.

For each testimonial, capture: review text, reviewer name, and country/nationality if present.

No generic/filler names; use only real names from the Yogabahia page.

Layout & behaviour

Display in a 3-column grid on desktop (7 rows for 21 items), 1 column on mobile.

Each item is a testimonial card:

Top line: Reviewer name, country (if available), and ★★★★★.

Below: show the first 2–3 lines (approx. 160–220 chars) as a preview.

Add a “Read more” toggle that expands to reveal the full text (accordion style), then “Show less” to collapse.

Keep the card style consistent with the site (rounded corners, subtle border, soft shadow).

Stars should use the brand accent colour (gold).

Styling tokens (use existing theme if already set)

Text: var(--brand-black); secondary/meta: var(--brand-taupe)

Borders/dividers: var(--brand-gray)

Stars/accents: var(--brand-gold)

Card: 1px border, 16px radius, soft shadow on hover (small lift).

Accessibility & polish

“Read more” control must be keyboard accessible and announce expanded/collapsed state (aria-expanded, aria-controls).

Maintain high contrast for text.

Do not truncate mid-word; add an ellipsis… only at natural breaks.

(Optional) Structured data

If review schema already exists, keep it valid.

Otherwise, you may omit schema for now (content accuracy takes priority); we can add/validate JSON-LD after the content swap.

Deliverable:
A Testimonials page that shows only real student reviews from Yogabahia (no placeholders), in a clean 3-column grid with preview + “Read more,” using exactly 21 items where possible.
