Please update the Mailing List Signup Page so that the three signup forms (Studio Classes, Online Classes, Retreats & Workshops) are more compact, while still easy to read and fill in.
Form Layout Adjustments:
Reduce vertical spacing and padding around each input field and label.
Use smaller font size for labels (but keep them legible).
Place each input field directly beneath its label with minimal space.
Shrink the overall form height so all three signup sections can be viewed on one screen without much scrolling.
Keep a small amount of whitespace between the three forms so they are clearly differentiated.
Branding:
For each signup form block, add:
YogaBahia logo (provided separately) in the top-left corner of the form section.
Iyengar Certification Mark logo (provided separately) in the top-right corner of the form section.
Both logos should be small but crisp, aligned to the corners, and not disrupt the form flow.
Forms should remain center-aligned under the logos.
Styling Notes:
Inputs: white background, thin grey border (#CDCDCB), rounded corners.
Buttons: orange (#ED991A) with white text; hover → golden yellow (#F6D207) with black text. Rounded corners.
Section heading and description remain above the logos + form.
